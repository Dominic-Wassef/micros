Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment.

For information on using Node.js, see the [Node.js Website][].

The Node.js project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md). The
[OpenJS Foundation][] provides support for the project.

**This project has a [Code of Conduct][].**

## Support

Looking for help? Check out the
[instructions for getting support](.github/SUPPORT.md).

## Release types

* **Current**: Under active development. Code for the Current release is in the
  branch for its major version number (for example,
  [v15.x](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/v15.x)). Node.js releases a new
  major version every 6 months, allowing for breaking changes. This happens in
  April and October every year. Releases appearing each October have a support
  life of 8 months. Releases appearing each April convert to LTS (see below)
  each October.
* **LTS**: Releases that receive Long Term Support, with a focus on stability
  and security. Every even-numbered major version will become an LTS release.
  LTS releases receive 12 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 18 months
  of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines have alphabetically-ordered code names,
  beginning with v4 Argon. There are no breaking changes or feature additions,
  except in some special circumstances.
* **Nightly**: Code from the Current branch built every 24-hours when there are
  changes. Use with caution.

Current and LTS releases follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). A
member of the Release Team [signs](#release-keys) each Current and LTS release.
For more information, see the
[Release README](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#readme).

### Download

Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>.

#### Current and LTS releases

<https://nodejs.org/download/release/>

The [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest/) directory is an
alias for the latest Current release. The latest-_codename_ directory is an
alias for the latest release from an LTS line. For example, the
[latest-fermium](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-fermium/) directory
contains the latest Fermium (Node.js 14) release.

#### Nightly releases

<https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/>

Each directory name and filename contains a date (in UTC) and the commit
SHA at the HEAD of the release.

#### API documentation

Documentation for the latest Current release is at <https://nodejs.org/api/>.
Version-specific documentation is available in each release directory in the
_docs_ subdirectory. Version-specific documentation is also at
<https://nodejs.org/download/docs/>.

### Verifying binaries

Download directories contain a `SHASUMS256.txt` file with SHA checksums for the
files.

To download `SHASUMS256.txt` using `curl`:

```console
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt
```

To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run
it through `sha256sum` with a command such as:

```console
$ grep node-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c -
```

For Current and LTS, the GPG detached signature of `SHASUMS256.txt` is in
`SHASUMS256.txt.sig`. You can use it with `gpg` to verify the integrity of
`SHASUMS256.txt`. You will first need to import
[the GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases](#release-keys). To
import the keys:

```console
$ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys DD8F2338BAE7501E3DD5AC78C273792F7D83545D
```

See the bottom of this README for a full script to import active release keys.

Next, download the `SHASUMS256.txt.sig` for the release:

```console
$ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt.sig
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
